"""
Optuna example that implements a user-defined relative sampler based on Simulated Annealing
algorithm. Please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing for Simulated
Annealing itself.

Note that this implementation isn't intended to be used for production purposes and
has the following limitations:
- The sampler only supports `UniformDistribution` (i.e., `Trial.suggest_uniform` method).
- The implementation prioritizes simplicity over optimization efficiency.

You can run this example as follows:
    $ python simulated_annealing_sampler.py
