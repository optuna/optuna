# Distributed Optimization on Kubernetes

This folder contains two kinds of examples with Kubernetes: one is based on [sklearn_simple.py](../sklearn_simple.py) and the other is based on [pytorch_lightning_simple.py](../pytorch_lightning_simple.py) with MLflow.

Currently, both [simple/sklearn_distributed.py](./simple/sklearn_distributed.py) and [mlflow/pytorch_lightning_distributed.py](./mlflow/pytorch_lightning_distributed.py) use POSTGRESQL for their backend of `optuna.Study.optimize` to be parallelized.  
Though we do not use it for MLflow records.  Of course, you can use POSTGRESQL as backend store of MLflow (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#where-runs-are-recorded), current example uses HTTP server.
