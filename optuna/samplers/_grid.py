class GridSampler(BaseSampler):
    """Sampler using grid search.

    With :class:`~optuna.samplers.GridSampler`, the trials suggest all combinations of parameters
    in the given search space during the study.

    Example:

        .. testcode::

            import optuna


            def objective(trial):
                x = trial.suggest_float("x", -100, 100)
                y = trial.suggest_int("y", -100, 100)
                return x**2 + y**2


            search_space = {"x": [-50, 0, 50], "y": [-99, 0, 99]}
            study = optuna.create_study(sampler=optuna.samplers.GridSampler(search_space))
            study.optimize(objective)

    Note:

        :class:`~optuna.samplers.GridSampler` automatically stops the optimization if all
        combinations in the passed ``search_space`` have already been evaluated, internally
        invoking the :func:`~optuna.study.Study.stop` method.

    Note:

        :class:`~optuna.samplers.GridSampler` does not take care of a parameter's quantization
        specified by discrete suggest methods but just samples one of values specified in the
        search space. E.g., in the following code snippet, either of ``-0.5`` or ``0.5`` is
        sampled as ``x`` instead of an integer point.

        .. testcode::

            import optuna


            def objective(trial):
                # The following suggest method specifies integer points between -5 and 5.
                x = trial.suggest_float("x", -5, 5, step=1)
                return x**2


            # Non-int points are specified in the grid.
            search_space = {"x": [-0.5, 0.5]}
            study = optuna.create_study(sampler=optuna.samplers.GridSampler(search_space))
            study.optimize(objective, n_trials=2)

    Note:
        A parameter configuration in the grid is not considered finished until its trial is
        finished. Therefore, during distributed optimization where trials run concurrently,
        different workers will occasionally suggest the same parameter configuration.
        The total number of actual trials may therefore exceed the size of the grid.

    Note:
        All parameters must be specified when using :class:`~optuna.samplers.GridSampler` with
        :meth:`~optuna.study.Study.enqueue_trial`.

    Args:
        search_space:
            A dictionary whose key and value are a parameter name and the corresponding candidates
            of values, respectively.
        seed:
            A seed to fix the order of trials as the grid is randomly shuffled. Please note that
            it is not recommended using this option in distributed optimization settings since
            this option cannot ensure the order of trials and may increase the number of duplicate
            suggestions during distributed optimization.
