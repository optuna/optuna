    """Base class for samplers.

    Optuna combines two types of sampling strategies, which are called *relative sampling* and
    *independent sampling*.

    *The relative sampling* determines values of multiple parameters simultaneously so that
    sampling algorithms can use relationship between parameters (e.g., correlation).
    Target parameters of the relative sampling are described in a relative search space, which
    is determined by :func:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.infer_relative_search_space`.

    *The independent sampling* determines a value of a single parameter without considering any
    relationship between parameters. Target parameters of the independent sampling are the
    parameters not described in the relative search space.

    More specifically, parameters are sampled by the following procedure.
    At the beginning of a trial, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.infer_relative_search_space`
    is called to determine the relative search space for the trial. Then,
    :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_relative` is invoked to sample parameters
    from the relative search space. During the execution of the objective function,
    :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_independent` is used to sample
    parameters that don't belong to the relative search space.

    The following figure depicts the lifetime of a trial and how the above three methods are
    called in the trial.
