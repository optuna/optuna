    """Multi-objective sampler using the NSGA-III algorithm.

    NSGA-III stands for "Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III",
    which is a modified version of NSGA-II for many objective optimization problem.

    For further information about NSGA-III, please refer to the following papers:

    - `An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based
    Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems With Box Constraints
    <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6600851>`_
    - `An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based
    Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part II: Handling Constraints and Extending to an Adaptive
    Approach <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6595567>`_

    Args:
        reference_points:
            A 2 dimension ``numpy.ndarray`` with objective dimension columns. Represents
            a list of reference points which is used to determine who to survive.
            After non-dominated sort, who out of borderline front are going to survived is
            determined according to how sparse the closest reference point of each person is.
            In the default setting the algorithm uses `uniformly` spread points to diversify the
            result.

        population_size:
            Number of individuals (trials) in a generation.
            ``population_size`` must be greater than or equal to ``crossover.n_parents``, and is
            also recommend to be greater than number of points in ``reference_points``.
            For :class:`~optuna.samplers.nsgaii.UNDXCrossover` and
            :class:`~optuna.samplers.nsgaii.SPXCrossover`, ``n_parents=3``, and for the other
            algorithms, ``n_parents=2``.

        mutation_prob:
            Probability of mutating each parameter when creating a new individual.
            If :obj:`None` is specified, the value ``1.0 / len(parent_trial.params)`` is used
            where ``parent_trial`` is the parent trial of the target individual.

        crossover:
            Crossover to be applied when creating child individuals.
            The available crossovers are listed here:
            https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/samplers/nsgaii.html.

            :class:`~optuna.samplers.nsgaii.UniformCrossover` is always applied to parameters
            sampled from :class:`~optuna.distributions.CategoricalDistribution`, and by
            default for parameters sampled from other distributions unless this argument
            is specified.

            For more information on each of the crossover method, please refer to
            specific crossover documentation.

        crossover_prob:
            Probability that a crossover (parameters swapping between parents) will occur
            when creating a new individual.

        swapping_prob:
            Probability of swapping each parameter of the parents during crossover.

        seed:
            Seed for random number generator.

        constraints_func:
            An optional function that computes the objective constraints. It must take a
            :class:`~optuna.trial.FrozenTrial` and return the constraints. The return value must
            be a sequence of :obj:`float` s. A value strictly larger than 0 means that a
            constraints is violated. A value equal to or smaller than 0 is considered feasible.
            If ``constraints_func`` returns more than one value for a trial, that trial is
            considered feasible if and only if all values are equal to 0 or smaller.

            The ``constraints_func`` will be evaluated after each successful trial.
            The function won't be called when trials fail or they are pruned, but this behavior is
            subject to change in the future releases.

            The constraints are handled by the constrained domination. A trial x is said to
            constrained-dominate a trial y, if any of the following conditions is true:

            1. Trial x is feasible and trial y is not.
            2. Trial x and y are both infeasible, but trial x has a smaller overall violation.
            3. Trial x and y are feasible and trial x dominates trial y.

            .. note::
                Added in v2.5.0 as an experimental feature. The interface may change in newer
                versions without prior notice. See
