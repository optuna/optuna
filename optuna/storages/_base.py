class BaseStorage(object, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """Base class for storages.

    This class is not supposed to be directly accessed by library users.

    A storage class abstracts a backend database and provides library internal interfaces to
    read/write histories of studies and trials.

    **Thread safety**

    A storage class can be shared among multiple threads, and must therefore be thread-safe.
    It must guarantee that return values such as `FrozenTrial`s are never modified.
    A storage class can assume that return values are never modified by its user.
    When a user modifies a return value from a storage class, the internal state of the storage
    may become inconsistent. Consequences are undefined.

    **Ownership of RUNNING trials**

    Trials in finished states are not allowed to be modified.
    Trials in the WAITING state are not allowed to be modified except for the `state` field.
    A storage class can assume that each RUNNING trial is only modified from a single process.
    When a user modifies a RUNNING trial from multiple processes, the internal state of the storage
    may become inconsistent. Consequences are undefined.
    A storage class is not intended for inter-process communication.
    Consequently, users using optuna with MPI or other multi-process programs must make sure that
    only one process is used to access the optuna interface.

    **Consistency models**

    A storage class must support the monotonic-reads consistency model, that is, if a
    process reads data `X`, any successive reads on data `X` cannot return older values.
    It must support read-your-writes, that is, if a process writes to data `X`,
    any successive reads on data `X` from the same process must read the written
    value or one of the more recent values.

    **Stronger consistency requirements for special data**

    Under a multi-worker setting, a storage class must return the latest values of any attributes
    of a study, not necessarily for the attributes of a `Trial`.
    However, if the `read_trials_from_remote_storage(study_id)` method is called, any successive
    reads on the `state` attribute of a `Trial` are guaranteed to return the same or more recent
    values than the value at the time of the call to the
    `read_trials_from_remote_storage(study_id)` method.
    Let `T` be a `Trial`.
    Let `P` be the process that last updated the `state` attribute of `T`.
    Then, any reads on any attributes of `T` are guaranteed to return the same or
    more recent values than any writes by `P` on the attribute before `P` updated
    the `state` attribute of `T`.
    The same applies for `user_attrs', 'system_attrs' and 'intermediate_values` attributes.

    .. note::

        These attribute behaviors may become user customizable in the future.

    **Data persistence**

    A storage class does not guarantee that write operations are logged into a persistent
    storage, even when write methods succeed.
    Thus, when process failure occurs, some writes might be lost.
    As exceptions, when a persistent storage is available, any writes on any attributes
    of `Study` and writes on `state` of `Trial` are guaranteed to be persistent.
    Additionally, any preceding writes on any attributes of `Trial` are guaranteed to
    be written into a persistent storage before writes on `state` of `Trial` succeed.
    The same applies for `user_attrs', 'system_attrs' and 'intermediate_values` attributes.

    .. note::

        These attribute behaviors may become user customizable in the future.
