    """Base class for hypervolume calculators.

    .. note::
        This class is used for computing the hypervolumes of points in multi-objective space.
        Each coordinate of each point represents one value of the multi-objective function.

    .. note::
        We check that each objective is to be minimized. Transform objective values that are
        to be maximized before calling this class's ``compute`` method.

    Example:
        .. testcode::

            import numpy as np

            import optuna
            from optuna.multi_objective._hypervolume import WFG
