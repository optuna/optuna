class HyperbandPruner(BasePruner):
    """Pruner using Hyperband.

    As SuccessiveHalving (SHA) requires the number of configurations
    :math:`n` as its hyperparameter.  For a given finite budget :math:`B`,
    all the configurations have the resources of :math:`B \\over n` on average.
    As you can see, there will be a trade-off of :math:`B` and :math:`B \\over n`.
    `Hyperband <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf>`_ attacks this trade-off
    by trying different :math:`n` values for a fixed budget.

    .. note::
        * In the Hyperband paper, the counterpart of :class:`~optuna.samplers.RandomSampler`
          is used.
        * Optuna uses :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler` by default.
        * `The benchmark result
          <https://github.com/optuna/optuna/pull/828#issuecomment-575457360>`_
          shows that :class:`optuna.pruners.HyperbandPruner` supports both samplers.

    .. note::
        If you use ``HyperbandPruner`` with :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler`,
        it's recommended to consider to set larger ``n_trials`` or ``timeout`` to make full use of
        the characteristics of :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler`
        because :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler` uses some (by default, :math:`10`)
        :class:`~optuna.trial.Trial`\\ s for its startup.

        As Hyperband runs multiple :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner` and collect
        trials based on the current :class:`~optuna.trial.Trial`\\ 's bracket ID, each bracket
        needs to observe more than :math:`10` :class:`~optuna.trial.Trial`\\ s
        for :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler` to adapt its search space.

        Thus, for example, if ``HyperbandPruner`` has :math:`4` pruners in it,
        at least :math:`4 \\times 10` trials are consumed for startup.

    .. note::
        Hyperband has several :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner`. Each
        :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner` is referred as "bracket" in the original
        paper. The number of brackets is an important factor to control the early stopping behavior
        of Hyperband and is automatically determined by ``max_resource`` and ``reduction_factor``
        as `The number of brackets = floor(log(max_resource) / log(reduction_factor)) + 1`. Please
        set ``reduction_factor`` so that the number of brackets is not too large　(about 4 ~ 6 in
        most use cases).　Please see Section 3.6 of the `original paper
        <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf>`_ for the detail.

    Args:
        min_resource:
            A parameter for specifying the minimum resource allocated to a trial noted as :math:`r`
            in the paper.
            See the details for :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner`.
        max_resource:
            A parameter for specifying the maximum resource allocated to a trial noted as :math:`R`
            in the paper. This value represents and should match the maximum iteration steps (e.g.,
            the number of epochs for neural networks).
        reduction_factor:
            A parameter for specifying reduction factor of promotable trials noted as
            :math:`\\eta` in the paper. See the details for
            :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner`.

            .. deprecated:: 1.4.0
                This argument will be removed from :class:~optuna.pruners.HyperbandPruner. The
                number of brackets are automatically determined based on ``max_resource`` and
                ``reduction_factor``.

            The number of :class:`~optuna.pruners.SuccessiveHalvingPruner`\\ s (brackets).
            Defaults to :math:`4`.
        min_early_stopping_rate_low:
            A parameter for specifying the minimum early-stopping rate.
            This parameter is related to a parameter that is referred to as :math:`r` and used in
            `Asynchronous SuccessiveHalving paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_.
            The minimum early stopping rate for :math:`i` th bracket is :math:`i + s`.
