## Guidelines

### Coding Style

Coding style is checked with [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org).
Additional conventions are described in the [Wiki](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Coding-Style-Conventions).

### Documentation

When adding a new feature to the framework, you also need to document it in the reference.
The documentation source is stored under the [docs](./docs) directory and written in [reStructuredText format](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

To build the documentation, you need to install [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org):

```bash
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Note that docstrings (documentation comments in the source code) are collected from the installed
Optuna module. If you modified docstrings, make sure to install the module
before building the documentation.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then you can build the documentation in HTML format locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

HTML files are generated under `build/html` directory. Open `index.html` with the browser and see
if it is rendered as expected.

### Type Hints

Type hints, [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), are checked with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

### Formatting

Code is formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black).
You have to install it first. This can be done with
`pip install black`. The command to format a certain file
is `black <filename_with_path> --line-length 99 --exclude="docs"`.
To just check the file you can use
`black <filename_with_path> --line-length 99 --check --exclude="docs"`.
You can also apply these operations to all files by replacing
`<filename_with_path>` with a simple `.`.

## Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, you also need to write sufficient test code.
We use [pytest](https://pytest.org/) as the testing framework and
unit tests are stored under the [tests directory](./tests).

You can run all your tests as follows:

```bash
# Run all the unit tests.
pytest

# Run all the unit tests defined in the specified test file.
pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME}
```

## Continuous Integration and Local Verification

CircleCI is used for continuous integration.

### Local Verification

By installing the [`circleci`](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/) local CLI and Docker, you can run tests locally.

```bash
circleci build --job <job_name>
```

You can run the following jobs.

- `tests-python35`
  - Runs unit tests under Python 3.5
- `tests-python36`
  - Runs unit tests under Python 3.6
- `tests-python37`
  - Runs unit tests under Python 3.7
- `tests-python38`
  - Runs unit tests under Python 3.8
- `checks`
  - Checks guidelines
- `document`
  - Checks documentation build
- `doctest`
  - Checks doctest validity
- `codecov`
  - Checks unit test code coverage

#### Example

The following `circleci` job runs all unit tests in Python 3.7:
Note that this job will download several hundred megabytes of data to install all the packages required for testing, and take several tens of minutes to complete all tests.

```bash
circleci build --job tests-python37
```

## Creating a Pull Request

When you are ready to create a pull request, please try to keep the following in mind.

### Title

The title of your pull request should

- briefly describe and reflect the changes
- end with a punctuation
- wrap any code with backticks

*The title will be directly visible in the release notes.*

#### Example

Introduces Tree-structured Parzen Estimator to `optuna.samplers`.

### Description

The description of your pull request should

- describe the motivation
- describe the changes
- if still work-in-progress, describe remaining tasks
