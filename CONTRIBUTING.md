# Contributing guidelines

Once you send a pull request, it is automatically tested on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).
By setting up the
[CircleCI Local CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/), you can check your code in your local
environment before submitting the pull request.


## Coding standards

The following circleci job runs code checking:

```
$ circleci build --job checks
```

The above job contains following checkers:
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org)
- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)

If any warnings or errors are emitted, please fix them.

Note that we use comment-style type annotation for compatibility with Python 2.

* [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
* [Syntax cheat sheet](http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet.html)

Please see also our [Coding Style Conventions](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Coding-Style-Conventions).

## Testing

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, you also need to write sufficient test code.
We use [pytest](https://pytest.org/) as the testing framework and
unit tests are stored under the [tests directory](./tests).

You can run your tests as follows:
```console
// Run all the unit tests.
$ pytest

// Run all the unit tests defined in the specified test file.
$ pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME}
```


### CircleCI Local CLI

The following circleci job runs all unit tests in Python 3.7:

```console
// Note that this job will download several hundred megabytes of data to
// install all the packages required for testing,
// and take several tens of minutes to complete all tests.
$ circleci build --job tests-python37
```

You can run tests and examples for each Python version using the following jobs:

- `tests-python35`
- `tests-python36`
- `tests-python37`
- `examples-python35`
- `examples-python36`
- `examples-python37`


In addition, to check the documents, run:

```
$ circleci build --job document
```


## Documentation

When adding a new feature to the framework, you also need to document it in the reference.
The documentation source is stored under [docs directory](./docs) and written in
[reStructuredText format](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

To build the documentation, you need to install [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org):

```
$ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Note that docstrings (documentation comments in the source code) are collected from the installed
Optuna module. If you modified docstrings, make sure to install the module
before building the documentation.

```
$ pip install -e .
```

Then you can build the documentation in HTML format locally:

```
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

HTML files are generated under `build/html` directory. Open `index.html` with the browser and see
if it is rendered as expected.
