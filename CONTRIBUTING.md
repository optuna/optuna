## Guidelines

### Setup Optuna

First of all, fork Optuna on GitHub.
You can learn about fork in the official [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

After forking, download and install Optuna on your computer.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/optuna.git
cd optuna
pip install -e .
```

### Checking the Format, Coding Style, and Type Hints

Code is formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
and docstrings are formatted with [blackdoc](https://github.com/keewis/blackdoc).
Coding style is checked with [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/),
and additional conventions are described in the [Wiki](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Coding-Style-Conventions).
Type hints, [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), are checked with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

You can check the format, coding style, and type hints at the same time just by executing a script `formats.sh`.
If your environment is missing some dependencies such as black, blackdoc, flake8, isort or mypy,
you will be asked to install them.

You can also check them using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) like below.

```
$ pip install tox
$ tox -e flake8 -e black -e blackdoc -e isort -e mypy
```

If you catch format errors, you can automatically fix them by auto-formatters.

```bash
# Install auto-formatters.
$ pip install ".[checking]"

$ ./formats.sh
```

### Documentation

When adding a new feature to the framework, you also need to document it in the reference.
The documentation source is stored under the [docs](./docs) directory and written in [reStructuredText format](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

To build the documentation, you need to run:

```bash
pip install -e ".[document]"
```
Note that the above command might try to install PyTorch without CUDA to your environment even if your environment has CUDA version already.

Then you can build the documentation in HTML format locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

HTML files are generated under `build/html` directory. Open `index.html` with the browser and see
if it is rendered as expected.

Optuna's tutorial is built with [Sphinx-Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html) and
some other requirements like [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) meaning that
all .py files in `tutorial` directory are run during the documentation build if there's no build cache.
Whether you edit any tutorial or not doesn't matter.

To avoid having to run the tutorials, you may download executed tutorial artifacts named "tutorial" from our CI (see the capture below) and put them in `docs/build` before
extracting the files in the zip to `docs/source/tutorial` directory.
Note that the CI runs with Python 3.8 and the generated artifacts contain pickle files.
The pickle files are serialized with [the protocol version 5](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format) so you will see the error with Python 3.7 or older.
Please use Python 3.8 or later if you build the documentation with artifacts.

**Writing a Tutorial**
Tutorials are part of Optuna’s documentation.
Optuna depends on Sphinx to build the documentation HTML files from the corresponding reStructuredText (`.rst`) files in the docs/source directory,
but as you may notice, [Tutorial directory](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/tree/master/tutorial) does not have any `.rst` files. Instead, it has a bunch of Python (`.py`) files.
We have [Sphinx Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html) that executes those `.py` files and generates `.rst` files with standard outputs from them and corresponding Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files.
These generated `.rst` and `.ipynb` files are written to the docs/source/tutorial directory.
The output directory (docs/source/tutorial) and source (tutorial) directory are configured in [`sphinx_gallery_conf ` of docs/source/conf.py](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/blob/2e14273cab87f13edeb9d804a43bd63c44703cb5/docs/source/conf.py#L189-L199). These generated `.rst` files are handled by Sphinx like the other `.rst` files. The generated `.ipynb` files are hosted on Optuna’s documentation page and downloadable (check [Optuna tutorial](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html)).

The order of contents on [tutorial top page](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html) is determined by two keys: one is the subdirectory name of tutorial and the other is the filename (note that there are some alternatives as documented in [Sphinx Gallery - sorting](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/gen_modules/sphinx_gallery.sorting.html?highlight=filenamesortkey), but we chose this key in https://github.com/optuna/optuna/blob/2e14273cab87f13edeb9d804a43bd63c44703cb5/docs/source/conf.py#L196).
Optuna’s tutorial directory has two directories: (1) [10_key_features](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/tree/master/tutorial/10_key_features), which is meant to be aligned with and explain the key features listed on [README.md](https://github.com/optuna/optuna#key-features) and (2) [20_recipes](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/tree/master/tutorial/20_recipes), whose contents showcase how to use Optuna features conveniently.
When adding new content to the Optuna tutorials, place it in `20_recipes` and its file name should conform to the other names, for example, `777_cool_feature.py`.
In general, please number the prefix for your file consecutively with the last number. However, this is not mandatory and if you think your content deserves the smaller number (the order of recipes does not have a specific meaning, but in general, order could convey the priority order to readers), feel free to propose the renumbering in your PR.

You may want to refer to the Sphinx Gallery for the syntax of `.py` files processed by Sphinx Gallery.
Two specific conventions and limitations for Optuna tutorials:
1. 99 #s for block separation as in https://github.com/optuna/optuna/blob/2e14273cab87f13edeb9d804a43bd63c44703cb5/tutorial/10_key_features/001_first.py#L19
2. Execution time of the new content needs to be less than three minutes. This limitation derives from Read The Docs. If your content runs some hyperparameter optimization, set the `timeout` to 180 or less. You can check this limitation on [Read the Docs - Build Process](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/builds.html).


## Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, you also need to write sufficient test code.
We use [pytest](https://pytest.org/) as the testing framework and
unit tests are stored under the [tests directory](./tests).

Please install some required packages at first.
```bash
# Install required packages to test all modules without visualization and integration modules.
pip install ".[test]"

# Install required packages to test all modules including visualization and integration modules.
pip install ".[optional,integration]" -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

You can run your tests as follows:

```bash
# Run all the unit tests.
pytest

# Run all the unit tests defined in the specified test file.
pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME}

# Run the unit test function with the specified name defined in the specified test file.
pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME} -k ${TARGET_TEST_FUNCTION_NAME}
```

## Continuous Integration and Local Verification

Optuna repository uses GitHub Actions and CircleCI.

Currently, we are migrating to GitHub Actions but still we use CircleCI for testing `document`
because it makes it much easier to check built documentation.

## Creating a Pull Request

When you are ready to create a pull request, please try to keep the following in mind:

### Title

The title of your pull request should

- briefly describe and reflect the changes
- wrap any code with backticks
- not end with a period

*The title will be directly visible in the release notes.*

#### Example

Introduces Tree-structured Parzen Estimator to `optuna.samplers`

### Description

The description of your pull request should

- describe the motivation
- describe the changes
- if still work-in-progress, describe remaining tasks

## Learning Optuna's Implementation

With Optuna actively being developed and the amount of code growing,
it has become difficult to get a hold of the overall flow from reading the code.
So we created a tiny program called [Minituna](https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/minituna).
Once you get a good understanding of how Minituna is designed, it will not be too difficult to read the Optuna code.
We encourage you to practice reading the Minituna code with the following article.
