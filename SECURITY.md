# Security Issue Reporting

Optuna uses [GitHubâ€™s Private Vulnerability Reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to enable responsible and confidential reporting of security issues.

If you discover a potential vulnerability, please report it to the development team through this feature:
 [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/security/advisories/new)

## How Reports Are Handled

- Your submission will remain confidential within the Private Vulnerability Report until the development team decides to share it publicly.
- The information you report will be used to help resolve security issues.
- The development team includes members with write or higher permission to the repository, as well as security managers.
- The development team will investigate and work toward a resolution.
  Please refrain from posting the issue in public forums such as GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, or social media until the fix or disclosure is complete.
- The timing of public disclosure will be determined through communication between the development team and the reporter.
  If the reporter prefers not to disclose the issue, it will remain private.

## Acknowledgment

We appreciate your help in improving the security and reliability of Optuna.
