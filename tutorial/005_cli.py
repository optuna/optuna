Command-Line Interface
======================

.. csv-table::
   :header: Command, Description
   :widths: 20, 40

    create-study, Create a new study.
    delete-study, Delete a specified study.
    dashboard, Launch web dashboard (beta).
    storage upgrade, Upgrade the schema of a storage.
    studies, Show a list of studies.
    study optimize, Start optimization of a study.
    study set-user-attr, Set a user attribute to a study.

Optuna provides command-line interface as shown in the above table.

Let us assume you are not in IPython shell and writing Python script files instead.
It is totally fine to write scripts like the following:
"""


import optuna


def objective(trial):
    x = trial.suggest_uniform("x", -10, 10)
    return (x - 2) ** 2


if __name__ == "__main__":
    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
    print("Best value: {} (params: {})\n".format(study.best_value, study.best_params))

# However, we can reduce boilerplate codes by using our ``optuna`` command.
# Let us assume that ``foo.py`` contains only the following code.


def objective(trial):
    x = trial.suggest_uniform("x", -10, 10)
    return (x - 2) ** 2


###################################################################################################
# Even so, we can invoke the optimization as follows.
# (Don't care about ``--storage sqlite:///example.db`` for now, which is described in :ref:`sphx_glr_tutorial_003_rdb.py`.)
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#     $ cat foo.py
#     def objective(trial):
#         x = trial.suggest_uniform('x', -10, 10)
#         return (x - 2) ** 2
#
#     $ STUDY_NAME=`optuna create-study --storage sqlite:///example.db`
#     $ optuna study optimize foo.py objective --n-trials=100 --storage sqlite:///example.db --study-name $STUDY_NAME

# By giving the script file name and the method name of objective function to
# ``optuna study optimize`` command, we can invoke the optimization.
